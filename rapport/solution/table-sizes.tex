The found points will be used to compute the size-references which will be used to know the size of a ball and also to find the playing surface ROI.




\textbf{Using the points to find the cloth:}
The reason for finding the diamonds is to be able to find the exact ROI to search for the balls. This ROI is defined as 93.5mm from the diamond in a orthogonal line to the edge of the cushion, as seen in \ref{fig:diamonddistance}.
