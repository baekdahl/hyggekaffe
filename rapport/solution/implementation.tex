The system is written in C\# using Microsoft Visual Studio 10. Since OpenCV\cite{opencv} is not compatible with C\# natively we use Emgu\cite{emgu} which is a wrapper for OpenCV to use in C\#. 

%The design of the system has been done using UML diagrams. UML makes it easier knowing which parts communicated with other parts, their included %methods and properties. The UML diagram for the PoolTracker can be seen in \ref{fig:uml}.
