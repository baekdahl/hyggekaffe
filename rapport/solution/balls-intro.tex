The main goal in this project is to detect and identify balls. There are different approaches to solving this problem, where some ideas concentrate on solving both problems at once by identifying balls directly and thereby also implicitly detecting them. Other solutions, like the one used in this project, does the detecting first to determine the regions of interest
