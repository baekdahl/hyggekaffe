Since the goal is to identify where each balls is between every shot an approach for detecting changes on the table have to be made. These changes should be changes in ball positions and not if a hand or a que is present in the image.\\

\subsection{Detect occlusions:}
The first step is to detect weather or not parts of the table is occluded or not. This occlusion could be caused by human interaction or foreign object placed within the cloth of the table. Detection will be used before finding position of balls. If the table is detected to be occluded then there will be no detection of balls before the table is no longer occluded. This will bring down faulty detections caused by cue or foreign objects.\\

When the table is detected\ref{sec:table-locate}, a mask for the cloth is made. This mask is made from a contour which have many different properties such as area and perimeter. These properties can be used when identifying if occlusions are present. By comparing the current image mask together with the mask made in the calibration and finding the difference in area or perimeter, detection should be possible.\\

Occlusion area factor:
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{Area_{current mask}}{Area_{calibrated mask}}
\label{eq:area}
\end{equation}

Occlusion perimeter factor:
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{Perimeter_{current mask}}{Perimeter_{calibrated mask}}
\label{eq:perimeter}
\end{equation}

For the purpose of this system occlusion will be defined as foreign object that enter the scene from the edge of the image. Therefore the balls or the chair will not be defined as an occlusion. \\

\textbf{Plot of factors:}\\
The plot\ref{fig:occlusion_plot} does not contain "Shadow II" factors since the perimeter is very high compared to the normal. This is due to the light being altered too much which is not allowed if the system as written in the requirement specification\ref{sec:reqspec}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/occlusion_plot}
\end{center}
\caption{Occlusion plot. Red triangles are occlusions and green squares are not.}
\label{fig:occlusion_plot}
\end{figure}

The red triangle (occlusion) that lie within the green square (non occlusion) is "Que on table II" which is occlusion by a small part of the que. \\
The green square (non occlusion) that lie between two red triangles (occlusions) is "Shadow" where a shadow is introduced by a person. This was done while also changing the light.\\

The following mean-values have been calculated for the non occlusions:\\

$\mu_{\gamma} = 0.998$\\
$\mu_{\kappa} = 1.059$\\

The occlusion detection is only done to determine if the balls position should be re-evaluated. Therefore it is not crucial that the detection is 100\% correct. A wrong detection will simply cause a re-evaluation of the balls position which would show no movement. Therefore it is optimal to make a "paranoid" classifier that would be more inclined to assume a occlusion than not.\\

Since an introduction of a foreign object will always make the contour area smaller and the perimeter bigger the values for a detection will be set to:

\begin{center}
$\gamma_{detection} if \gamma < 0.99$ \\
or\\\\
$\kappa_{detection} if \kappa > 1.04$.
\end{center}

\subsection{Detect movement of balls:}
After an occurred occlusion it is required to detect if movement of the balls is present. If there have been movement the balls would be found, identified and saved as one NAAAAAVN. If no movement is detected then the balls are expected to be in the same position which is already saved.\\
