The goal of this part of the solution is to find the diamonds on the outer rails of the table and thereby know exactly where the nose of the rail is located. This will give the entire playing fields position and no more than that.

The table is detected to find a ROI (region of interest) where the diamonds should be found. Then the diamonds are detected and processed. The playing field should now be easily found.

Lastly the ball and table sizes are calculated based on the distances between the diamonds.
