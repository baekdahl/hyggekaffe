Since the system does not know where the table is or which kind of table it is, a method for finding a general pool table has been developed. The outcome of this section will be a method to determine where the cloth (playing field) of the table is. This will serve as the ROI (region of interest) for further detection of balls. There are many methods that could be used to find the ROI. The key is to find a robust one that will also not be too computationally heavy. Besides finding the ROI, the angle of the table compared to the x-axis of the image must also be found. This will be used to rotate the input stream from the camera to 0\degree and later crop it to the ROI. The mask of the cloth will also be found for use in other parts of the system.\\
