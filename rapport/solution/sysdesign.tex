The system is written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 10. Since OpenCV\cite{opencv} is not compatible with C# natively we use Emgu\cite{emgu} which is a wrapper for OpenCV to use in C#. 

The design of the system has been done using UML diagrams. UML makes it easier knowing which parts communicated with other parts, their included methods and properties.
