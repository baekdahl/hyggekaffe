Finding the table is important since this will allow the region of interest to be smaller than the input from the camera. This will also bring down computationtime in several other parts of the project.

There are several approaches that could be used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Search for the table as a big rectangle.
	\item Search for the diamonds that are placed throughout the table.
	\item Finding the most common colour (the cloth) and then find the outer points of the cloth.
\end{itemize}
