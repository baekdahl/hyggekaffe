To find the table and balls it is important to understand how the table and balls appear in different color spaces. In this section the colors of the table and the pool balls will be measured for further analysis.\\

\subsubsection{The table}
As written in the rules\ref{sec:rules} the table cloth colour has to be yellow-green, blue-green or electric blue. The cloth color should be constant, but dependent on the lightning the variance of the cloth on the input image could be significant.

The table which has been used for measuring is a pool table with blue-green cloth which is located in Aalborg University's lab in room A6-314!

Three different images of the pool table and one image with the cloth cut out are analysed first in HSV color space and then i RGB space. These analysis will be used in the solution chapter.

\subsubsection{The balls}
The success of the system depends on the identifier to be able to separate the pool balls from each other. To analyze the separability, histograms of all the different solid balls has been computed. This has been done in hue-saturation space, to see if it is possible to be independent of brightness. Being independent of brightness will make the system more resistant towards changes in light. The histograms are grouped together based on the color similarity, to visualize how the colors can be separated

\textbf{Ball color composition}\\
To be able to detect whether or not a ball is solid or striped it is important to know how much white is in a ball. The images used can be seen in figure \ref{fig:ballscompo} which is based on the balls used in this project.

In table \ref{fig:ballscompotable} the percentage of white pixels can be seen.\\
