The goal for the project is to do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
	\item Detect position of table.
	\item Detect position of balls.
	\item Identify balls with high accuracy.
	\item Position and identification of balls should be obtained within one second
	\item Work with mixed light conditions and not only those stated in WPAB rules in section \ref{sec:rules}.
	\item Be made into a working prototype.
%	\item Be easily used by players. %Lars Bo Warning!
\end{itemize}

The completed system is not required to:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
	\item Calibrate camera parameters and undistort image.
	\item Track balls when they are moving.
	\item Act as a referee and make the players obey the rules.
	\item Work with very difficult light conditions.
\end{itemize}

For the system to work certain requirements must be set:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
	\item The full table must take up 75\% of the image and  be viewable with no parts occluded.
	\item The exposure and focus of the camera must be optimal and oversaturation should not occur.
	\item Ball coloring and cloth coloring must follow WPAB regulations as described in \ref{sec:rules}.
\end{itemize}
