The completed system should be able to do the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find location of table.
	\item Find location of diamonds within  
	\item Estimate table and ball dimensions.

	\item Find location of balls between shots when ball are lying still.
	\item Identify balls with 100\% confidence. %Fix when realistic measures have been done.
	
	\item Work with mixed light conditions and not those stated in \ref{sec:rules}, but for more difficult conditions.
	
	\item Be made into a working prototype.
	
%	\item Be easily used by players. %Lars Bo Warning!
\end{itemize}

The completed system should not be able to do the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Calibrate camera parameters and distort image.
	\item Track the balls movement except when they lie still between shots.
	\item Act as a referee and make the players obey the rules.
	\item Work with difficult light conditions.
\end{itemize}
For the system to work certain requirements must be set:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The full table must take up 75\% of the image and  be viewable with no parts occluded.
	\item The exposure and focus of the camera must be optimal and saturation should not occur.
	\item Table and equipment must follow WPAB regulations as described in \ref{sec:rules}.
\end{itemize}
