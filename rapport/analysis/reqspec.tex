The goal for the project is to do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
	\item Detect position of table.
	\item Detect position of balls.
	\item Identify balls with high accuracy.
	\item Position and identification of balls should be obtained within one second
	\item Work with mixed light conditions and not only those stated in WPAB rules\ref{sec:rules}.
	\item Be made into a working prototype.
%	\item Be easily used by players. %Lars Bo Warning!
\end{itemize}

The completed system is not required to:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
	\item Calibrate camera parameters and un	distort image.
	\item Track the balls movement except when they lie still between shots.
	\item Act as a referee and make the players obey the rules.
	\item Work with very difficult light conditions.
\end{itemize}

For the system to work certain requirements must be set:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
	\item The full table must take up 75\% of the image and  be viewable with no parts occluded.
	\item The exposure and focus of the camera must be optimal and over saturation should not occur.
	\item Ball colouring and cloth colouring must follow WPAB regulations as described in \ref{sec:rules}.
\end{itemize}
