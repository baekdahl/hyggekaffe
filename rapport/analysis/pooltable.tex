This project will focus on pool tables (pocket billiards). There are many different types of pool such as 8-ball, 9-ball and 14-1. The types differentiate some, but the table and the rest of the equipment is the same. 

The international pool regulations concerning table size, cloth colour, ball size and etc. are regulated by "World Pool-Billiard Association". These specifications will be understood in order to know what size of table, ball etc. that has to be looked for while doing the image processing.


In \ref{fig:partspool} a standart pool table is seen from top view. Different indications of pockets etc. are marked.
