This project will focus on pool tables (pocket billiards). There are many different types of pool such as eight-ball, nine-ball and 14-1. The types differentiate some, but the table and the rest of the equipment is the same.

\textbf{Table Specifications:}
The international pool regulations concerning table size, cloth colour, ball size and etc. are regulated by "World Pool-Billiard Association"\cite{poolregulations}. These specifications will be used in order to know what size of table, ball etc. that have to be looked for while doing the image processing.

In \ref{fig:partspool} a standard pool table is seen from top view. Different indications of pockets etc. are marked.
