\chapter*{Preface}
This report describes the development of a 8th semester project at Vision Graphics and Interactive Systems Masters programme at Aalborg University. The theme for the semester is Analysis and Synthesis of Images. 

The report is divided into 3 parts: Analysis, Design and Implementation and Test and Conclusion. The analysis part consists an analysis of the pool game, the pool table and the balls. Design and Implementation describes the methods used and how they have been implemented. In the part Test and Conclusion, the acceptance test is described which leads to a conclusion of the project.

This project should be understood by people who have a knowledge of computer vision and the different theories that are included in this field.

The software and videos used for this project are enclosed with the report on Aalborg University's project database.

The pool table used for measuring and testing is a pool table with blue-green cloth located in Aalborg University's lab at Niels Jernes Vej 12 in room A6-314.
