The report describes the creation of a system with capability to locating and identifying pool table and balls using a standard webcam. The use of a webcam would make the solution available to consumers.

Research have been conducted on the specifications on the game of pool, the table and the balls. Especially colors of table and balls in different color spaces have been examined since this is what is used in the methods which contains detection and identification.

The solution is introduced by an overview of the system and which parts it should contain. The detection of table is done using the information about the cloth and this works. The position of the balls are found using knowledge about the cloth color and the distribution of colors in a ball. The identification of the balls is done by using euclidean distances between training data and detected data. The method works in some cases, but because of the webcam inability to produce images with good color distribution it often fails.
