The companies Valdemar BIRN and T \& O Stelectric presented a problem concerning quality assessment of metal objects using computer vision. In the report this problem is presented and discussed. A number of specific requirements were set leading to a handfull of problems that needed to be solved.  Some of these problems were picked out and although several systems were discussed only four were developed. These are "Direction \& Position", "Object Validation", "Surface error detection" and "Label readability verification".\\
"Direction \& Position": Finds the directions and positions of the objects on the input images. \\
"Object Validation": Validates that an object entering the system is of the right type. \\
"Surface Error Detection": Scans the objects surfaces for errors. \\ 
"Label Redability Verification": Verifies that the lables on the objects is readable. \\ 

The different subsystems were developed, originaly to fit into a shared object library that can be loaded into a program and run. The system was then ment to accept or discard the said object based on input images. In the end this system wasn't developed to the fullest and a complete test coulden't be made. Also lack of training data made the training of the system difficult and has some responsibility in some of the subsystems not being completely developed.\\
The principle for each subsystem has been shown and tested. It turns out that some work still has to be made in order to make this system work.
