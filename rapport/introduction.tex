\subsection{Project Background}
The inspiration for this project comes from the article "Development of an Automatic Pool Trainer"\cite{larsbopool} made by Lars Bo et al. Where that project focus on making a pool trainer with only two different balls detected, this project will focus on tracking all balls. 
\\\\
The reason for making a robust PoolTracker are mainly for entertainment. The solution developed could be used for making a more developed pool trainer, a game for computer or console or simply for tracking balls to improve and understand your own strengths and weaknesses.
\\\\
The focus is to make a robust, easy to use and simple solution that will not require the user to set many parameters. The use of a standard webcam will also make the solution inexpensive which is a key point if the solution is made into a game for personal use and entertainment.

\subsection{Hypothesis}
Is it possible with a standard inexpensive webcam to correctly detect table and identify balls in mixed lighting?
