\subsection{Project Background}
The inspiration for this project comes from the article "Development of an Automatic Pool Trainer"\cite{larsbopool} made by Lars Bo et al. Where that project focus on making a pool trainer with only two different balls detected, this project will focus on tracking all balls. 
\\\\
The reason for making a robust PoolTracker are mainly for entertainment. The solution developed could be used for making a more developed pool trainer, a game for computer or console or simply for tracking balls to improve and understand your own strengths and weaknesses within the game of pool.
\\\\
The focus is to make a robust, easy to use and simple solution that will not require the user to set many parameters. It is very important that this is archived since small glitches and failure to detect balls and table will make the user abandon the solution. The use of a standard webcam will make the solution inexpensive which is a key point when developing for personal use and entertainment.
\\\\
The solution will not include actual live tracking, but only the balls positions between shots. Further development of the solution could include this. As in \cite{larsbopool} the solution could also be expanded to use a projector to show ball positions, help lines for shooting balls in pockets and training environments. 

\subsection{Hypothesis}
How can we, with a standard inexpensive webcam, correctly detect a pool table and identify pool balls in mixed lighting?
