1) Introduction stortion and settings)
			Track while moving
			Obey rules
			With difficult light conditions	

3) Solution 

	*System design and implementation
		-UML
		-EMGU C#
		
	*Finding table and sizes
		Introduction
		Locate table
		Locate diamonds
		Find sizes

	*Finding and identifying balls (somewhat tracking).
		Introduction
			Not using video vs. only images
			Identifying straight away vs. detect first and id after
			
			Problem of lighting conditions
		-Locating balls
			Balls in close proximity
			Background changing color - ball shadows
			Background not avaliable because other balls i close proximity
						
		-Identifying balls
			ID by colors, shape is equal
			Problem of balls of same color
			Different ways the ball can face - different amount of color visible
