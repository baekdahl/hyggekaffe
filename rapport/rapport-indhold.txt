1) Introduction stortion and settings)
			Track while moving
			Obey rules
			With difficult light conditions
			
Ball Analysis
	Identifiablity in different color spaces vs. light conditions
	Hue space problems
	Striped / solid (Calculate the ratio between white and colored pixels)
		Graf x-akse: white-ratio: solid(no number), solid(number), striped(min), striped(max), cue ball
		husk at histogrammer ikke inkluderer low sat
		value histogram for den sorte og den hvide

3) Solution 

	*System design and implementation
		-UML
		-EMGU C#
		
	*Finding table and sizes
		Introduction
		Locate table
		Locate diamonds
		Find sizes

	*Finding and identifying balls (somewhat tracking).
		Introduction
			Not using video vs. only images
			Identifying straight away vs. detect first and id after			
			Problem of lighting conditions
		
		-Locating balls
			-Solution ideas:
				blob analysis
				background cross corellation
				template matching(as used by others?)
				
				
			Balls in close proximity
			Background changing color - ball shadows
			Background not avaliable because other balls i close proximity
			Balls on close proximity íntroduces multivariate
			
		-Identifying balls
			Counting good pixels
				White and one color(bimodal)
			ID by colors, shape is equal
			Problem of balls of same color
			Different ways the ball can face - different amount of color visible
