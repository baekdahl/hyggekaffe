1) Introduction

2) Analysis
	*Pool table specs	+MORE
	*Pool terminology
	*Pool table rules and regulations
	*Pool table situations
		-Break
		-White/Black in hole
		-Ball in hole
		-Ball falls off table
		-Ball cluttering

	*Other work

	*Requirement specification (Specify HARD!)
		-What we will do:
			Find position of table
			Estimate table and ball dimentions 
			Find positions of balls between frames
			Work in mixed light conditions (!=pool standard=bar)
			Make working prototype
			Set camera to no saturation, focus and "good" conditions.

		-What we will not do:
			Calibrate camera (distortion and settings)
			Track while moving
			Obey rules
			With difficult light conditions	

3) Solution 

	*System design and implementation
		-UML
		-EMGU C#
		
	*Finding table and sizes
		Introduction
		Locate table
		Locate diamonds
		Find sizes

	*Finding and identifying balls (somewhat tracking).
		Introduction
		Locating balls
		Identifying balls

4) Test of system

5) Conclusion
